# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Using-Excel

👋 Hi, I’m @abdelrahmanabdelmoez

🎉🌟Excited to Share My First Complete Data Analysis Project Using Excel🌟🎉

I recently completed my first full data analysis project, and I’m thrilled to share the journey and key steps.

💡 Project Overview: The data included:

Sales Data (2020-2023), separated into four sheets by year.
Product Data, organized by category across multiple sheets.
Customer Data on a separate sheet.

🎯 The goal was to consolidate, clean, and analyze the data, ultimately creating an interactive dashboard to answer critical business questions.

🛠️ Steps Taken:

 1- Data Import and Transformation with Power Query:

- Imported the original data to automate steps like appending sales and product data into unified sheets (SalesData and ProductData).

- Added custom columns for Total Sales, Total Cost, Total Profit, and Product Category (which was initially found only in the sheet names).

- Used "Fill Down" to manage missing values for Manager and SalesRep Name fields.

- Replaced values with nulls where needed, removed duplicates, blank rows, and performed additional cleaning to make the data suitable for analysis.

2- Data Modeling with Power Pivot:

- Linked SalesData, ProductData, and Customer Data tables.

- Established relationships to streamline data analysis.

3- Calculations with Pivot Tables:

- Created measures and calculations using Pivot Tables for insightful analysis.

4- Interactive Dashboard Creation:

- Developed an interactive dashboard using our measures and Pivot Tables, providing dynamic insights to support business decisions.

✨ What I Learned:

- How Power Query can be used for complex data transformations and automation, including adding custom columns, extracting information from sheet names, and using fill down.

- Data Modeling to establish relationships and pivot tables for calculations.

- The importance of data cleaning and processing for accurate analysis.

- Create interactive dashboards using excel.
